# Babystats Frontend ðŸ‘¶ ðŸ‘¶ ðŸ‘¶

This repo houses the frontend application for tracking your newborns stats during their first couple of months.

## Background

I was tired of writing in a physical journal, so decided to build this.

## What can you do with this app?

You can track your newborns progress:

- Number of ðŸ’¦ and ðŸ’© diapers
- Weight
- Length
- Head circumference

## Why use this vs. other apps out there?

This isn't connected to anything. Take the code, run it on your own server.

In fact, there isn't a login built in. Mostly because I'm lazy, but I really don't want to host this.

Although, if you want to pay me to set this up for you - more than happy to. Hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/home).
